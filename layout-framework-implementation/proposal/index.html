            Redesign a site with Bootstrap

                MACURH is an acronym for the Midwest Affiliate of College and University Residence Halls. It is a division of NACURH: the National Association of College and University Residence Halls. NACURH is the largest, student-run organization in the world, advised by professionals usually within the Division of Student Affairs at hundreds of campuses across the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://www.macurh.nacurh.org/" target="_blank">site</a> is currently built on Wix, has a disjointed visual style, includes links that direct offsite without warning, and has a lackluster organization that makes finding information difficult. I would like to use the <a href="https://www.macurh.nacurh.org/macurh-method" target="_blank">MACURH Standards</a> of Leadership, Education, Growth, Family, and Tradition to rebuild the site in a way that prioritizes users.
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose this organization because I have recently been elected into the role of Coordinating Officer for Marketing & Publications for the 2020-2021 academic year. In this role, it is one of my main goals to revamp the website, as it has been many years since the initial design was developed. Here are some other divisions of NACURH and how they structure their sites:
